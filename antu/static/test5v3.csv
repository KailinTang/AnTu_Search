Other food items have to be part of the diet plan. It is important to consume plenty of fluids throughout the day. Almased is a great addition to a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.To replace an entire meal, dissolve one bag os Almased in 10 to 12 oz of water and add 2 tsp of oil high in essential fatty acids (e.g. olive, flaxseed or walnut oil). It is important to follow these mixing instructions as Almased is not a complete food item by itself.You can also dissolve Almased in low fat milk or unsweetened almond or soy milk. For a variety of flavors, try adding cinnamon, ground flaxseeds, vanilla extract or unsweetened cocoa powder.If you want to use Almased in addition to your daily diet (without replacing an entire meal), this is how to do it:Takins 2 to 5 Tbsp of Almased throughout the day (with some liquids, yogurt, cereal, etc.) contributes to your daily required protein intake (0.8 g/kg body weight based on the dietary protein requirements). Athletes who work out intensely can take up to 100 g (= 2 servings) of Almased in addition to their daily diet.
